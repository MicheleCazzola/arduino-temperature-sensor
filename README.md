## General information
**Course**: `Electronic Systems, Technologies and Measurements`, module of `Electronic Measurements` (`Polytechnic of Turin`)  
**Academic Year**: 2022-23, laboratory activities between November and December 2022  
**Main teachers**: Simona Donati Guerrieri (module of `Electronic Systems and Technologies`), Alessio Carullo (module of `Electronic Measurements`), Giovanni Antonio Costanzo (laboratory professor)  
**Topic**: implementation of Arduino and Python-based software to perform temperature measurements using analog sensors, and propagate their uncertainty.

## Repository structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `lm335`: scripts for LM335 measurements
- `Pt100`: scripts for Pt100 measurements

## Details
Arduino scripts are used to handle measurements.  
Uncertainty quantification is performed using Python scripts.
